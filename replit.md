# Cricket Auction Platform - System Architecture Guide

## Overview

This is a cricket auction management platform built with a modern full-stack architecture. The application allows administrators to manage cricket auctions with player bidding, team management, and real-time auction features. It uses React with TypeScript for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for data persistence, and Firebase for authentication.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client, server, and shared components:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite (SPA)
- **Backend**: Express.js + TypeScript (REST API)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Library**: Uses shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom cricket-themed color palette
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: React hooks + TanStack Query for server state synchronization
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth integration with React context

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with in-memory implementation (MemStorage)
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL with migrations
- **Session Management**: Connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware

### Database Schema
The application defines several key entities:
- **Users**: Admin authentication (username/password)
- **Players**: Cricket players with categories, pricing, and stats
- **Teams**: Auction teams with budgets and player counts
- **Auctions**: Active bidding sessions with real-time state

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Firebase Authentication**: Handles admin login/logout
- **Role-based Access**: Admin-only access to dashboard and auction management
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions for server-side state

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**: Firebase handles admin authentication, redirecting to dashboard on success
2. **API Communication**: Frontend uses TanStack Query for server state management
3. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database queries
4. **Real-time Updates**: Prepared for WebSocket integration for live auction features

## External Dependencies

### Key Frontend Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React 18, React Router (Wouter), React Hook Form
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
- **State Management**: TanStack Query
- **Authentication**: Firebase SDK

### Key Backend Dependencies
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless, Drizzle ORM
- **Session Storage**: connect-pg-simple
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution, Vite for frontend bundling

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Setup
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Backend**: tsx for TypeScript execution with nodemon-like behavior
- **Database**: Drizzle migrations for schema management

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds static assets to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL for production database
- **Environment**: Node.js production server serving both API and static files

### Key Configuration Files
- **Vite**: Configured for React with path aliases and Replit integration
- **Drizzle**: PostgreSQL configuration with migrations directory
- **TypeScript**: Shared configuration across client/server with path mapping
- **Tailwind**: Custom theme with cricket-specific colors and component paths

The architecture supports scalable auction management with real-time capabilities, admin authentication, and a modern development experience with type safety throughout the stack.
